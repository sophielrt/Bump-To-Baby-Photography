Additionally, a services section was added inbetween the "About Me" and "Testiomonials" section to better structure the content, as this is currently a one-page website.

## Bugs
1. The first bug I encountered was with my testimonials carousel.The control where not working, meaning it would autoplay, but users couldn't manually navigate it. The issue occurred because I had two carousels with controls using the same ID's, causing the testionimals carousel to be overidden by the first one. Once I assigned unique identifying properties to each carousel, they functioned independently, with controls correctly targeting their respective elements using the data-bs-target property.
2. The secound bug I encountered was with the testimonials link in the navigation bar. The ID was missspelled in the navigation link; however, it still directed users to the testiomonials section on the page. The issue was that the link appeared black when clicked instead of matching the colour of the other links. Once the spelling error was corrected, the testimonials navigation link functioned as exspected.
